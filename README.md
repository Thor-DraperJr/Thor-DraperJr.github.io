## What up! My name is Thor Draper Jr

Currently, I work at Microsoft as an Azure Network Support Escalation Engineer and a cybersecurity instructor at 2U education. I'll also do the occasional sales consulting for MSPs. Before my role at Microsoft, I spent the early part of my career in sales, management, entrepreneurship, and the military.

If you'd like to look at my resume, [here's a link!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVRo5wngTWiR01oggedOsMEI-hbYYwAFX4POfL_GSTQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### About Me

I love staying busy. Before I knew it, I had over 10 years of sales experience, and in 2019, I ended up with an opportunity to buy a gym in my hometown. During my time running my business, I started preparing for my next career transition. I took the CompTIA ITF+ in June and got hooked! My father had been in cybersecurity for years, and it turns out that I also enjoyed IT. While lining up my certification track, I figured I could knock two birds out with one stone. After a conversation with the local junior college, I discovered that I could get my associate's degree almost entirely with certifications. I'm proud to say I earned my associate's degree in Cloud and Virtualization in July 2021. I love taking certifications and currently hold over 15 certifications (just take a peek at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thor-draperjr/), I think I added all of them there).
