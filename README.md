### Professional Background

I am an individual who thrives on staying active and busy. My early career was heavily focused on sales, and in 2019, I had the opportunity to purchase a gym in my hometown. While running my business, I began to explore my next career move and discovered a passion for the IT industry. I took the CompTIA ITF+ in June and was hooked. My father had been in cybersecurity for years and I found that I shared his interest in the field. I was able to earn my associate's degree in Cloud and Virtualization in July 2021, mostly through certifications. I am dedicated to continuing my education and am currently in possession of over 15 certifications.
