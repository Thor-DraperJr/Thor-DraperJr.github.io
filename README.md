# About Thor
What up! My name is Thor Draper Jr.
## What do you do for work?
I have the following job titles:

- Microsoft Azure Network Support Engineer
- Cybersecurity Instructor with Trilogy Education
- Sales Consultant

I know, it sounds like a lot but I'm sure the list is going to grow. If you'd like to look at my resume [here's a link!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVRo5wngTWiR01oggedOsMEI-hbYYwAFX4POfL_GSTQ/edit?usp=sharing)
## Why do you have so many jobs?
I love staying busy.

I'm just a regular guy that has over 15 years of sales experience. In 2019, I decided I'd transition into IT. My focus has been in cybersecurity and cloud networking. I firmly believe that I'm going to be able to find or create an opportunity that will allow me to become marry my sales accument with my technical skillset.

I guess, the main reason I have so many jobs is because I've owned my own business. Once your the boss you finally understand that business hours aren't really a thing. Also, you just need to be prepared for the next thing that turns out to be a big opportunity, and trust me. There will be a next thing.
## Where are you from?
I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. From a young age I notieced two things about myself - I had the gift of gab and I liked being in a leadership position more than I liked being a member. I was heavily involved in Boy Scouts and because of that involvment I made the decision to go through the RCIA process and join the Catholic church. At 17, I earned the Eagle Scout rank. A few years later I joined the Army National Guard as an 11B infantryman.

Those years had the most to do with the man that I am today. I have an owner's mentality toward every endeavor I partake it. I pride myself on communication and exceeding expectations. My success was driven by being methodical and process-driven.
