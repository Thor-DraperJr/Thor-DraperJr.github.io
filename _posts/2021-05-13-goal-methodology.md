Go from Goal changer to Goal doer.
 
## Introduction
After posting about Warran Buffets’ 25/5 rule for goal setting, I had some conversations about defining a goal. First and foremost, I want you all to know that your goals aren't wrong. Regardless of size, if it's important to you, then it's a good goal. However, I did see a common theme on ways you can improve the clarity of your goals. Here are some of the nuggets I gathered from those conversations.
#### Here’s the agenda:
* Tasks v. Goals v. Wishes
* S.M.A.R.T Methodology
 
### Tasks v. Goals v. Wishes
As I was tasked with the heavy responsibility of answering, "is this a good goal?" I kept seeing two pitfalls show up. The first being the goal was so specific it was a daily activity. The second pitfall was that it was so broad you could fit multiple goals into it. Instead of having five goals, you had twelve disguised as five. I decided to categorize them as the following:
 
1. **Tasks:** These were often written out as a "Do x daily.” Tasks tended to be about setting up good habits. They were written in the same style of a to-do list for that day or week. Often they supported something else on this list. If you combined all of the like tasks, they turned into a sound strategy for success.
 
For example, running a marathon showed up on a list you'd see stretch daily or drink a gallon of water each day. These felt like habits or parts of a strategy they knew they needed to have to be successful.
 
2. **Wishes:** On New Years, my mom would wish people happiness, healthiness, and prosperity. A wish would often be written extremely broad or intentionally written to include multiple goals.
 
Take the run a marathon example again. It might show up as be healthy/lose weight or more on the nose as run a marathon to lose weight. They don't sound different, but training for a marathon just to lose weight doesn't exactly go hand in hand. Yes, they're similar, but you need to take into consideration your diet and effort.
 
Honestly, I just saw this as a way of having a goal and not sacrificing anything as a distraction.
 
3. **Goals:** You just know a good one when you see one. The main similarity is that most of the time, the goals showed up as the first or second item on the list. It was also the one that had the most tasks written as a supporting part as well.
 
My observation is that goals create tasks, but tasks do not create goals.
 
### S.M.A.R.T Methodology
The SMART method is my favorite methodology to use for goals. By adopting a process that can be refined and improved as time goes forward, you give yourself a better chance of accomplishing what you set out to do. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely.
 
* **Specific** - be able to state your goal and what you want clearly. 
 
* **Measurable** - be able to quantify your results.
 
* **Attainable** - be mindful of the requirements, credentials, and experience necessary to accomplish the goal.
 
* **Relevant** - be sure the goal aligns with your values and interests
 
* **Timely** - be able to have a date to evaluate progress
 
Bringing back the example of running a marathon, the only two considerations would be setting a date and factoring in your current conditioning. Using this methodology, a SMART goal would change run a marathon to Run the Kings Mountain Marathon on October 9th, 2021.
 
It's specific because you've named the exact marathon you'd like to run. It's measurable because you know it's over once you run 26.2 miles. It's attainable because there's enough time to condition for the date. It's relevant as long as you like running. Finally, it’s timely because you know the date on which you'd have to accomplish it.
 
A good SMART goal is written in a which you know exactly what you need to accomplish. Sure, I could spin off registering for the event or sticking to a weekly training program, but those are tasks to give a good strategy for success.
