Go from Goal changer to Goal doer

## Introduction
After posting about Warran Buffets 25/5 rule for goal setting I had some conversations about defining a goal. First and foremost, I want you all to know that your goals aren't wrong. Regarless of size if it's important to you than it's a fine goal. I did see a common theme on ways you can improve the clarity of your goals. Here are some of the nuggets I gathered from those conversations.
#### Here’s the agenda:
* Tasks v. Goals v. Wishes
* S.M.A.R.T Methodology
* Final Thoughts

### Tasks v. Goals v. Wishes
When looking over some lists people found that some of their goals were apart of other goals, so how could they label them distractions?

Tasks tended to be good behaviors - like working out every day.

Wishes are those general be wealthy, healthy, and happy.

Don't bundle goals. If you said I didn't have to sacrifice any but your goals have thirty different aspects to them...c'mon

The goals were being broken up into tasks. So as someone was writing 25 goals down they would have 3 or 4 tasks that supported that goal. An example would be creating a capstone project and behind it would be code for 30 minutes a day and register for an online course.

Goals create tasks, but tasks do not create goals.

### S.M.A.R.T Methodology
My absolute favoriteBy using SMART goals you adopt a process that can be refined and improved as time goes forward. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely.

**Specific** - be able to clearly state your goal and what you want. 

I spent a long time working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. My aha moment came from changing my growth goal from “rent more cars” to “grow by x%” and then breaking down that number into daily tasks and identifying the number of cars I needed to put on the road daily.

**Measurable** - be able to quantify your results.

Do you know if you are progressing to it. Finances were frequently a part of the goals that people shared with me. Making more money is nice but if you proportionally increase your spending you didn’t exactly accomplish your goal.

**Attainable** - be mindful of the requirements, credentials, and experience necessary to accomplish the goal.

Make sure that 

**Relevant** - be sure the goal aligns with your values and interests

Be mindful of pitfalls and time sucks. Some goals are frivolous wants. I don’t have an example but you know it when you see it. It’s the goal that means quite a lot today and shocks you how little time you spent working on it when you check your progress.

**Timely** - be able to have a date to evaluate progress

Know the end date and the iteration you need to check on your progress.


### Final Thoughts
The big goals came first on the list. They were big and generally sub-goals and tasks were written.
