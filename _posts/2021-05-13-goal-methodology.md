Go from Goal changer to Goal doer

## Introduction
After posting about Warran Buffets 25/5 rule for goal setting I had some conversations about defining a goal. Here are some of the nuggets I gathered from those conversations.
#### Here’s the agenda:
* Tasks v. Goals
* S.M.A.R.T Methodology
* Final Thoughts

### Tasks v Goals
The goals were being broken up into tasks. So as someone was writing 25 goals down they would have 3 or 4 tasks that supported that goal. An example would be creating a capstone project and behind it would be code for 30 minutes a day and register for an online course.

Goals create tasks, but tasks do not create goals.

### S.M.A.R.T Methodology
By using SMART goals you adopt a process that can be refined and improved as time goes forward. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely.

**Specific** - be able to clearly state your goal and what you want. 

I spent a long time working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. My aha moment came from changing my growth goal from “rent more cars” to “grow by x%” and then breaking down that number into daily tasks and identifying the number of cars I needed to put on the road daily.

**Measurable** - be able to quantify your results.

Do you know if you are progressing to it. Finances were frequently a part of the goals that people shared with me. Making more money is nice but if you proportionally increase your spending you didn’t exactly accomplish your goal.

**Attainable** - be mindful of the requirements, credentials, and experience necessary to accomplish the goal.

Make sure that 

**Relevant** - be sure the goal aligns with your values and interests

Be mindful of pitfalls and time sucks. Some goals are frivolous wants. I don’t have an example but you know it when you see it. It’s the goal that means quite a lot today and shocks you how little time you spent working on it when you check your progress.

**Timely** - be able to have a date to evaluate progress

Know the end date and the iteration you need to check on your progress.


### Final Thoughts
