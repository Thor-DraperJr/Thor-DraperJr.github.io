It's not what you know; it’s who you know, but if your career changer and you're not allowed to meet people in person, how the heck do you meet anyone? Today I'm going to talk to you about how to virtually grow your network using tools and websites you already have access to.

### Before you reach out

My prerequisite is to make sure you don't explain away why this connection needs to happen. For some reason, when we introduced ourselves, we also feel like we have to include some back story or history behind why we're doing something. You're reaching out to Industry experts because you want to get more information, create a connection, get a mentor. Any of those things are valid reasons for why you're doing this. Ultimately you're telling this person that you're hoping to create a connection to use them in some type of way. Hopefully, you're contacting somebody who wants to give back, but if you aren't, then you're going to get ignored, and it's time for you to move on to the next person anyway. So keep in mind it's okay for you to not get responses to this. The effort will take you to your destination. The main thing is you don't want to make this person read a couple of paragraphs about who you are, where you come from, where you have been, where you hope to go, and then you ask them for their time. They probably already spent two minutes reading the paragraphs that you sent them, and that's more time than they had that day anyway. 


### How to find people to reach out to 

#### Reach out to speakers from webinars on YouTube

Hopefully, you're already watching webinars. This is a great way to professionally develop, but I think many people Overlook the second slide. Generally, you have the topic slide, and the second side is who is speaking and what makes them a subject matter expert on what you're about to listen to. This person put time into this presentation. They obviously care about what it is, so if you pay attention to that name their job title and look them up on LinkedIn, you're going to find people who care about this specific topic, so you watched it, you have something in common. That gives you an easy introduction to why you two should talk further.  

#### Utilize MeetUp and virtual conferences

I said to a live event secondary to the recorded webinars on YouTube because you have to have a little more tact to execute this one effectively. First, if it's a Meetup, generally, there's a presentation portion that goes on. I'd keep an eye out for who organized the most active event in the chat, and then make sure that you equipped yourself with some good questions to make yourself recognizable when you do Reach Out. You're likely not going to schedule a time to follow up with anybody right then and there. You still will have to follow up and do your research on who they are on LinkedIn, so just keep in mind it's going to make you were a couple of passive at the exact same point in time. I think the strategy is to attend as many Live Events as you possibly can with virtual conferences. Again, it's just so you can scope out those chat boxes to participate with the speaker so they at least stand a chance to recognize your name or maybe recognize a question that you can reference when you do reach out to them. Lastly, if you can't see somebody live, most of these things are turned into on-demand videos that you can reach out to you after. Even those are still an excellent way to try to add people to your Rolodex. 

### What to say when you're reaching out

My Go-to message: hey, my name is Thor. I saw you in this YouTube video and wanted to know if I could pick your brain about the subject. I know this seems a little out of the blue, but how else are we supposed to network in a virtual world?

### How to set up the appointment

Mention that you want to be on Video. You can settle for a phone call, but if you're not, at least allowing yourself to see the person ultimately, you're going to put yourself in a position where you can be a little bit more forgettable. In an ideal world, you're going to build a relationship with this person who can vouch for you and who knows this person might be able to give you a job or contract you directly and give you the money you don't know what that opportunity could be. Still, they’re only going to fight for you as much they care for you.
