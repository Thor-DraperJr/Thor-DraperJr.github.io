You’re supposed to check the alignment on your tires at least once a year. On top of ensuring a smooth ride, you get benefits like gas mileage and proper road contact. You should also check your personal alignment to your goals.

## Introduction
I’m going to beat the ‘take your care to the body shop’ metaphor to death in this article but it’s really relevant here and works. While looking at existing tire wear is one way to identify misalignment, It’s ideal to have your vehicle aligned annually to help catch and correct any misalignment issues before you experience early and unnecessary tire wear. Here’s how you catch it early:

### Common Signs of Misalignment

1. You get new tires.
When you create a new goal are you able to take actionable steps on them immediately? Take stock algorithm recommendations. It sounds silly, but if you aren’t getting suggested YouTube videos or news articles relevant to your goals it’s a sign that you haven’t been interested in looking at that topic online.

2. You lower or lift your vehicle.
I’m going to interpret this as hitting a massive milestone. For instance, if a milestone was getting a degree, promotion, or certification. As you level up check to see if you tasks to support your goal are still appropriate. A common pitfall is keeping the bar low so it’s easy to always say that you are working toward your goal. As you get better you should probably increase your expectations.

3. Suspension parts that affect the tire angles are replaced or adjusted.
Environment changes. So much can happen between a long-term goal. Moving to a new city, getting a new job, and meeting new people.

4. You’ve had a fender-bender or a hard impact with a curb or road debris.
Failure is a part of the journey. In the example of 

5. It’s been a year since your last one.
If you’re cruising along take a moment to align.

6. You notice uneven tire wear, steering pull, or an off-center steering wheel.
If your results have stalled.



### Tips Before Getting Service
1. If you have a worn or bad part replace it first
2. Ask the tech for your measurements prior to the alignment and after for your records
