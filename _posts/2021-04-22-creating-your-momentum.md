## Tagline
Imagine that time where things just were going your way. I’ve always been told that luck is just timing meeting preparation. After navigating a career change, I realized that I needed to implement some strategies to get the ball to bounce my way a few more times than not!


## Introduction
Have you heard of ego depletion? It’s essentially the idea that your mind has a finite amount of resources that can be used. Understanding that made me realize that if I couldn’t make the resources larger, I had to make the way I utilized them smarter. After taking an inventory of how I spent my time and effort, I realized specific themes kept showing up.

Here’s the plan:
* Removing anchors
* Be able to elevator pitch your vision
* Stop doing things tomorrow
* Thrive under preparation
* Fail forward

### Removing anchors
Keep in mind that Anchors aren’t exclusively negative. There’s a great story about Warren Buffet advising his pilot Mike Flint. One day he asked for advice on career priorities. He had Mike write down his top 25 goals or things he wanted to accomplish. He circled the top 5 and put them on List A, and the other 20 were on List B. Flint initially thought that List A was his primary focus and List B would be his intermittent list that wasn’t as urgent. Buffett replies, “No. You’ve got it wrong, Mike. Everything you didn’t circle became your Avoid-At-All Cost list.”

### Be able to elevator pitch your vision
The clearer your objective, the more opportunities you’ll find. Be able to say your intentions quickly. When you’re sharing your vision with others, be receptive to feedback. Prepare the answers to answer the following questions: What is your why?. If you come across someone who can help, what is your ask? 

### Stop doing things tomorrow
By being specific with your time commitments. Put them on a calendar and block out the time that you care about. Take note of the tasks you consistently reschedule and gauge how you prioritize tasks.

### Thriving under preparation
Remove the “I could have done it if I could have tried” excuse. Thriving under pressure sounds fantastic, but manic preparation tends to make those moments easier less frequent. Preparation is all about hard work, sacrifice, discipline, organization, consistency, and more. It’s the classic Benjamin Franklin line, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”

### Fail forward
I kept changing the date I was going to start becoming a morning person strictly because I didn’t want to start 0 for 1. For some reason, I cared about my batting average in a game that absolutely zero people cared about the analytics. I care less about streaks and more about admitting that I failed and analyzing why.
