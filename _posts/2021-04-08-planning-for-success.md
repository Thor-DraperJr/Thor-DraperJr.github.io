Imagine walking into a sales presentation, and right as you finish shaking hands with your prospect, they turn to you and say, you know what? Forget the slides. I'm ready to sign! Are you prepared to answer that question? The answer might surprise you. I'm going to go over how to Plan for Success and how this strategy can directly increase your closing ratio.

### Here’s the agenda:
* Effective pre-call planning
* Discussing “our” future
* Defining a win
* Leveling up by following up

### Effective pre-call planning

Plan to win. It's been extremely disheartening being a part of pre-call phone calls where most of the conversation was about what rebuttal we were about to face. It felt like it was more about preparing for battle. But I've challenged my clients to clearly and concisely answer how they would handle the client immediately, asking for a close. 

Are you ready to ask your qualifying questions? Are you prepared to ask and present an initial ask - whether that’s a signature or payment? Can you get that out clearly and concisely? 

The reason I love this experiment is that it puts winning at the front of your mind. It’s a terrible feeling having a successful interaction and finding out that you were to the person that wasn’t prepared for this to go well. You don’t want to give a person a reason to think, “if they normally don’t get a positive response, what am I missing?”

### Discussing “our” future

During the meeting, the strategy I like using best is planning for a successful future with the prospect. This is your chance to start discussing what a successful 30 60 90 days and what that looks like together—discussing the immediate plan of attack and which heartburn to alleviate first. I like this because it works and interviews as well. Most hiring managers have a pain point that there's something they need on their staff, and this is your moment to imprint the idea that you are that solution. Before leaving, you're trying to leave an impression of them seeing themselves in a relationship with you.


###  Defining a win

A win isn’t always a signature on a contract. Success is determined by the decision being made.
A clearly defined win, from my perspective, comes from the prospect of either moving forward or giving you an objection. If you’re asked for more information by the end of your presentation, unfortunately, it looks like the table wasn't set for a sales meeting. At some point, they thought that this was an information session, and you just gave them a live webinar. 


###  Leveling up by following up

Lastly, the follow-up. This is the thing that you should be the most excited about. This is where regardless of the decision, but, especially in the cases of rejection, you can reach out to that person and specifically ask for feedback on what the deciding factor was for their decision. Ask them if there was anything that you could have done differently. I'm telling you, don't just ask these questions, really dig. This is a person who's already decided not to move forward with a relationship with you, so what do you have to lose. This is a moment where you literally can only win because you would gain more insight into how you come across in this exact situation. What can be eye-opening is if you feel uncomfortable asking this information or digging and asking the vet that the second level, you didn't build enough rapport, which means you didn't lay in a strong enough and action during the time you had with that person.
