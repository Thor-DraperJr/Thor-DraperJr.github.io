They say that you’re the average of the five people you spend the night. They also say that if you want to improve, you need to get a mentor. The question is, how do you raise the average?

As the world has gone virtual, the nature of relationships has had to change. Mentorship is essential to professional development, and the times dictate you need to adjust your communication style to maintain your relationships. The good news is that you have a unique opportunity to maximize the effectiveness of those mentorships. I’ve found that the three most important mentors to target have been: Subject Matter Experts (SME’s), Attestors, and Accountability Partners. In this post, I’ll define the types of mentors, give strategies on finding them, and conduct the meeting.

### Here’s the agenda:
* Defining the types of mentors
* SME’s
* Attestors
* Accountability Partners

### Defining the types of mentors

Type # 1:

Subject Matter Experts are highly knowledgeable in the field or ideally working in the position you want. The aim is to find somebody who can give you insight into how they specifically achieved their results.

Type # 2:

Attestors. By definition, this is a person who is going to vouch for you. You’ll know you found a good attestor if they are willing to introduce you to their network. You’d like this person to be a banner waiver for you and be a credible source of how you can add value.

Type # 3:

Accountability Partners could be a peer or someone who is slightly ahead of you.

### SME’s
I’ve found the best way to meet the SME is to search within your company first (the internal directory if your company has one) or searching for a position title on LinkedIn. Even for the mentors I’ve found in my own company. I’ve like reaching out to them on LinkedIn first with a quick connection request asking them to pick their brain about the career path.

I aim to set up an initial meeting for 30-45 minutes. I try to provide multiple dates and times to schedule the meeting (or just take a peek at their available time in their calendar). I aim to make sure that this is done formally and painlessly. I make sure I take the initiative to send the calendar invite as well.

When it comes to the meeting, be sure to prepare a few questions. Be mindful of the time that you set. The aim is to stay in that window and maximize the time. Come in with specific questions and aim to take away actionable items or milestones to accomplish. Be clear on where you are and share your goals. The clearer you are about where you want to go, the easier it is to give specific directions.

As you wrap up the meeting, I recommend setting up a tentative follow-up range. The SME’s time is precious, so it’s best to meet with them quarterly or every 60 days. You want to make sure that you have enough time to achieve a milestone or make a significant dent toward one.

Lastly, thank them for the time and make sure that your conversations are constantly adding value.

### Attestors
In my experience, attestors can be managers, project maintainers, or referral partners. In the tech space, it’s great to find an Attestor by contributing to a project. Generally, these mentors are a bit easier to find, but they require you to spend time between meetings to maintain effectively.

While you may be asked to contribute or volunteer outside of regular hours, I suggest asking them to set aside time to help you set goals. First, if you’re going to do something, you want to do it well. Secondly, you want to make sure that you give the Attestor plenty of ammunition to brag on your behalf to their network. Most meetings should be fueled by conversations about how to improve and to get direct feedback on results.

The frequency for meetings should be every 30 days. It’s normal to get reviews from your company, but I think it’s often an oversight in other settings.

###  Accountability Partners
This is the most informal of all three relationships. It’s also your most organic and frequently spoken to. You must have an open dialogue. You’ll want to be able to talk about the struggles. Be honest about the failures. And keep them in the loop for the wins.

I recommend setting time aside every two weeks to have a formal status update. The ideal relationship looks like a knowledge share. You’ll find that people grow at a much faster rate when they have to declare goals and give updates on whether you got closer or farther from it.
