title:  "Infrastructure as Code"

I have a sneaking suspicion that Infrastructure as Code is going to become increasingly important as time goes on. So, while I have some downtime I figured I'd start on my journey.

First, let's define it: [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code.

In laymens terms: IaC lets you take templates of your deployment and deploy them with a command.

The focuse of this tutorial is going to be:
1. Create your `azuredeploy.json` file
2. Create your `azuredeploy.parameters.json` file
3. Set up GitHub Actions to deploy your changes directly into your environment

## Step 1: The Greenfield Deployment
Items you'll need installed locally:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* The lastest [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
* The [Azure Resource Manager Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools&azure-portal=true) extension


First, you are going to want to create your local repository and deploy your first local template.
```powershell
mkdir IaC-Pipeline

cd .\IaC-Pipeline\

git init
```
Next, connect to your Azure portal and create a new resource group.
```powershell
Connect-AzAccount

New-AzResourceGroup `
  -Name pipeline `
  -Location "East US"
```

You can start by taking a peek at the templates that are automatically generated in Azure. These are ARM templates. There is also [Azure quickstart templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)

First we are just going to deploy a black template. In order to do that we'll use the Azure PowerShell command `New-AzResourceGroup Deployment`. The parameters we'll need to specify are the resource group and a name to the deployment to identify it in the deployment history. Next we'll be creating a variable referencing the path to the template file. This is going to speed up the deployment commands going forward.

```powershell
$templateFile = "{provide-the-path-to-the-template-file}"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name blanktemplate `
  -ResourceGroupName pipeline `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile
```

To get started you'll want to do a resource

Next, you can start with a resource deployment.

=====


Use linked templates to deploy complex solutions. You can break a template into many templates and deploy these templates through a main template. When you deploy the main template, it triggers the deployment of the linked template. You can store and secure the linked template by using a SAS token.

A CI/CD pipeline automates the creation and deployment of development projects, which includes ARM template projects. The two most common pipelines used for template deployment are Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions.

Back to the IaC Pipeline directory - create a file - azuredeploy.json

![azure deploy w/ resource group](/assets/images/1-pipeline.png)

```powershell
Get-AzSubscription

$context = Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId {Your subscription ID}
Set-AzContext $context

Set-AzDefault -ResourceGroupName pipeline
```
Deploy the template to Azure
The following code deploys the template to Azure. The ARM template doesn't have any resources yet, so you won't see resources created. You will see a successful deployment.

Deploy the template by using Azure PowerShell commands in the terminal.

```powershell
$templateFile = "azuredeploy.json"
$today=Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$deploymentName="blanktemplate-"+"$today"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile
```
The top section of the preceding code sets Azure PowerShell variables, which include the path to the deployment path and the name of the deployment. Then the New-AzResourceGroupDeployment command deploys the template to Azure. Notice that the deployment name is blanktemplate with the date as a suffix.

Navigate back to the *azuredeploy.json* file and add storage to the resource. Most will auto populate. Be sure to change the 'resource' "name", 'resource' "displayname", 'sku' "name", and 'sku' "tier". (Storage account name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only.)

run the deploy template again
```powershell
$templateFile = "azuredeploy.json"
$today=Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$deploymentName="addstorage-"+"$today"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile
```

ARM template parameters enable you to customize the deployment by providing values that are tailored for a particular environment. For example, you pass in different values based on whether you're deploying to an environment for development, test, production, or others. For example, the previous template uses the Standard_LRS storage account SKU.

When you deploy the template, you can give a value for the parameter. Notice the last line in the following command:

```powershell
$templateFile = "azuredeploy.json"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name testdeployment1 `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile `
  -storageAccountType Standard_LRS
```
![sku parameters](/assets/images/3-pipeline.png)

Next you'll want to add parameters for the name and the rest of the SKUs. This will give you a new deployment command as well.

![](/assets/images/4-pipeline.png)
```powershell
$today=Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$deploymentName="addOutputs-"+"$today"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile `
  -storageName thordraperjrpipeline `
  -storageSKU Standard_LRS
```

![adding parameters azure deploy](/assets/images/5-pipeline.png)
```powershell
$templateFile = "azuredeploy.json"
$today=Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$deploymentName="addVariable-"+"$today"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile `
  -storagePrefix thordraper `
  -storageSKU Standard_LRS
```

```powershell
$templateFile = "azuredeploy.json"
$parameterFile="azuredeploy.parameters.json"
$today=Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy"
$deploymentName="addParameterFile-"+"$today"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
  -Name $deploymentName `
  -TemplateFile $templateFile `
  -TemplateParameterFile $parameterFile
```





```Azure CLI
projectName="GitHubActionExercise"
location="eastus"
resourceGroupName="${projectName}-rg"
appName="http://${projectName}"

# Create the resource group
az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location $location

# Store the resource group ID in a variable
scope=$(az group list --query "[?contains(name, '$resourceGroupName')].id" -o tsv)

# Create the service principal with contributor rights to the resource group we just created
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $appName --role Contributor --scopes $scope --sdk-auth
```

###
* string: characters
* integer: numbers
* array: list separated by: "value",
* object:

Expressions are values that are evaluated when the template is deployed. They start and end with brackets, [ and ], and can return a string, integer, Boolean, array, or object.

```json
"parameters": {
  "location": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]"
  }
},
```
The expression is the value of the defaultValue: attribute. Notice that this expression holds the ARM template function resourceGroup(). This function returns information about the resource group that this template is deploying to. The .location retrieves one property from the object returned by the function. Functions allow you to construct values you need dynamically.
