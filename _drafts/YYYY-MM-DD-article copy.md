A beginners guide to standing out in a training program online.

## Introduction
As some of you may know, I've been in the training space for most of my career.  
Currently, I instruct at a Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
In the beginning, I'm asked about strategies to succeed.
Stand out, by standing out. 

#### Hereâ€™s the agenda:
* Participate early and often
* Check your syntax
* How to ask questions
* Lab
* Supplemental Resources
* The Mentals
### Participate early and often

Adding to the conversation.
Utilize commmunication - raising hand, the chat, and slack.
Put things in your own words to confirm understanding.
Be okay with missing the mark.
Your traininers should be your first advocates.

### Check your syntax

Read carefully.
Finish documents all the way through.
    avoid that nightmare elementary assignment that makes you do a bunch of things and the last step is to ignore all of the steps and just write your name at the top.


###  How to ask questions

Put the questions in your own words.
    Avoid "What does x mean".
    If you're CTRL+C and CTRL+V'ing the question verbatim you're not engaging that part of your brain that is trying to understand.
Show your thought process
    When reading this I'm interpreting it as x


### Lab

Hands-on tends to be the best way to commit things to memory.
If you can recreate a lab that's great.
If you're inspired to create that's even better.
While creating, document.
Once you document, share your work.

### Supplemental Resources.

Reading.
Build your framework and trust the process.
Find your edutainers.
Join discord.

### The mentals
It's a marathon not a sprint.
Don't kill yourself and spend hours on hours to finish the homework.
It's okay to not understand something.
Identify holes in your researching trategy.
Your mentals will matter.
